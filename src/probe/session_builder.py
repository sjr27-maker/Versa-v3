"""The single place a fully-wired `SessionLoop` is assembled — called by
BOTH `cli.py` (`probe chat` / `probe consolidate-session`) and
`webserver.py` (`probe serve`).

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS: it didn't, until 2026-09-15. Before this,
`cli.py` and `webserver.py` each built their own `SessionLoop`
independently. `cli.py`'s `_build_interaction_pipeline` wired
`claim_store`, `stated_preference_store`, `reference_binding_store`,
and the whole interaction/retrieval pipeline (`interaction_recorder`,
`retrieval_pool`, `history_block`'s dependencies) into the CLI path —
and its own docstring said, in writing, that this was "deliberately
NOT into `probe serve` ... until the hand-read described in this
feature's own review has actually happened there too." That hand-read
never happened. Every session run through `probe serve` — the actual
web UI, the one a browser hits — ran with NONE of it: no claims, no
stated preferences, no reference bindings, no history block, no
interaction pipeline at all. Confirmed by running a real session
through the real HTTP routes and reading `node_calls`/`turn_diagnostics`
back (see `tests/test_webserver_interaction_pipeline_wiring.py`): every
one of those blocks reached `FinalAnswer`'s prompt once wired in.

This is the fifth instance of the same failure class in this
codebase's history (see git log / CLAUDE.md's own incident-driven
invariants for the others — the hypothesis store running empty,
`load_dotenv` never being called, the Gemini schema silently
overriding the prompt): something built, verified in isolation, and
never wired into the path that actually runs. The fix here is
structural, not a one-time sync: `cli.py` and `webserver.py` both call
`build_session_loop` below. Neither constructs a `SessionLoop` any
other way. A future optional layer added to this function reaches both
entry points by construction — there is no second place to remember to
update, because there is no second place at all.
