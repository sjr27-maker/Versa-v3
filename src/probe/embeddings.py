"""Embedding client — the memory layer's own LLMClient-equivalent
(probe.llm.LLMClient), but for vectors instead of text.

`gemini-embedding-001` is a Matryoshka-trained model: requesting a
smaller `output_dimensionality` still yields a usable embedding (just
truncated to fewer leading dimensions, not a degraded/different
model), and doing so keeps embeddings inside pgvector's actual index
limits — verified live: this pgvector build (0.8.6, see migration 030)
rejects an HNSW index on a `vector(3072)` column outright ("column
cannot have more than 2000 dimensions for hnsw index"), while a
`vector(768)` column indexes cleanly. 768 is EMBEDDING_DIM below, not
a config value: it's baked into the migration's column/index
definitions, so changing it means a new migration, not a runtime flag.
