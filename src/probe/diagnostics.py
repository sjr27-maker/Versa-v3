"""Append-only store for turn_diagnostics — one row per handle_turn()
call, persisting what SessionLoop already computes each turn (call
counts, whether MAX_CALLS_PER_TURN fired, entropy_bits, wall-clock
duration, warnings, whether Teach itself failed) so the web UI's
Diagnostics panel can read it directly instead of re-deriving anything
— see the "zero business logic in the UI" constraint this store exists
to satisfy.

No delete method, no DELETE SQL — a turn's diagnostics are a
historical fact once recorded, same append-only spirit as every other
store in this project.

        coding that equivalence as a SQL literal would drift the moment

        AblationConfig() in Python cannot.
