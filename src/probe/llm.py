    whose result a node will JSON-parse (see `_SCHEMA_BY_PREFIX`
    above); TEACH: is exempted since its output is free-text shown
    directly to the student.

    Retry/timeout/rate-limit handling lives entirely at this boundary —
    but as its own explicit loop, not the SDK's built-in
    `HttpRetryOptions` (build_tier_clients disables that at the
    genai.Client level, attempts=1). The SDK's retry is opaque tenacity
    machinery with no callback hook: it logs a generic "retrying in N
    seconds" line to its own internal logger with no way to attach
    which node/model/prompt the retry belongs to. Owning the loop here
    means a throttled call and a genuinely slow call are distinguishable
    — every attempt logs model, prompt prefix, attempt number, the HTTP
    status that triggered it, and the backoff chosen — and `retry_count`
    gives SessionLoop a running total it can snapshot per turn for
    turn_diagnostics (see loop.py's _total_retry_count).

    Retries only transport-level failure modes (timeout, 429, 5xx) and
    never touches a 200 response whose body a node's own validation
    later rejects. See `LLMTransportError` for why those two layers are
