"""The session loop, after the full Diagnose/Infer/Update/Replan/Plan
reasoning path and the tree-based branch system were removed. Two
architectures remain, chosen once per session by
`ablation_config.mode` (ablation.py):

- `SessionMode.MINIMAL_BRANCH` (the default) -> `_handle_disambiguation_turn`:
  the minimal three-call flow (disambiguate.py) — AssessAndBranch ->
  [DisambiguationOptions] -> FinalAnswer, at most three LLM calls per
  exchange — wrapped by the memory layer (memory.py): a semantic
  pre-check that can skip branching entirely when a past fact for this
  learner already resolves the message, and a per-turn fact write.
- `SessionMode.BASELINE` (`ablation_config.is_full_bypass`) ->
  `_handle_bypass_turn`: one plain-LLM call per turn, no scaffolding at
  all. The floor MINIMAL_BRANCH is measured against.

All node invocations flow through `_call_node`, which records inputs
and outputs to `node_calls` per CLAUDE.md invariant 2. `turn_diagnostics`
(diagnostics.py) is written once per turn, opt-in via `diagnostics_store`.

`consolidate_session` (memory.py steps 6-8) is background-only — see its
docstring — driven by `probe consolidate-session`, `run_interactive`'s
turn-count-gated auto-trigger on exit, and the web UI's explicit
"End session & consolidate" button, never by `handle_turn` itself.
