"""Minimal three-call disambiguation flow — a new, separate reasoning
mode (`AblationConfig.reasoning_mode = ReasoningMode.DISAMBIGUATE`,
wired in via `SessionLoop._handle_disambiguation_turn`) that replaces
the branch tree / SelectBranch / DerivePath / Plan / concept-graph
machinery outright for a session run this way. Not an ablation of the
full system — a deliberately shallow, separate architecture, measured
against it, exactly the way `AblationConfig.is_full_bypass`'s
plain-LLM baseline is.

At most three LLM calls to fully resolve one exchange with the
student, spread across up to two `handle_turn` invocations — never
more than two calls in a single one:

1. `AssessAndBranch` — is the student's message genuinely ambiguous or
   under-specified? If not: proceed straight to `FinalAnswer` with no
   branch context, in the SAME turn (2 calls total: assess, then
   answer). If so: propose 2-4 distinct plausible readings of what the
   student means, wants, or is asking. Every call is persisted
   (`DisambiguationTurn` + `DisambiguationBranch` rows) unconditionally,
   whether or not `needs_branches` fires — a turn judged unambiguous is
   a queryable row with zero branches, not a gap in the record.
2. `GenerateOptions` — one clickable option per branch, generated only
   when `needs_branches` fired. Options are shown to the student
   INSTEAD of an answer this turn: no `FinalAnswer` call happens yet.
   This turn costs 2 calls (assess + options) and produces no answer.
3. `FinalAnswer` — runs on a LATER turn, once the student has resolved
   which reading they meant:
   - a click: that option's branch is marked matched, every sibling
     branch (and its option) in the same generation is superseded, and
     `FinalAnswer` runs immediately with the matched branch's statement
     as context. `AssessAndBranch` does NOT run this turn — the
     reading is already known. 1 call, one turn.
   - typed text instead of a click: no attempt is made to match the
     typed text against the old branches (that generation's branches
     are superseded, unmatched, exactly as if nothing had been
     offered) — this is a deliberate choice, not a missing feature; a
     free-text match here would just be RESOLVE:MATCH's interpretation
     layer smuggled back into a mode built specifically to avoid it.
     Instead the typed message is treated as this turn's own new
     input to `AssessAndBranch`, called fresh, with a note that the
     student typed past offered options threaded into its prompt (see
     `_TYPED_PAST_NOTE_TEMPLATE`) — their own words become one more
     input to what they meant, not a discarded signal. This turn then
     costs 2 (unambiguous: assess + answer) or 2 (ambiguous again:
     assess + options, no answer yet) calls by the same logic as any
     other fresh message.

So a full branching exchange costs 3 calls total (1 to assess + 1 to
raise options, then 1 more once resolved by a click) — matching this
feature's "3 (branching)" framing exactly, at the level of one full
exchange with the student. A fully direct exchange costs 2 (assess,
then answer), not the "1 (direct)" the originating spec named.

This is a deliberate, disclosed departure from that literal number,
not an oversight: `AssessAndBranch` must run on every fresh message to
even know a message is unambiguous in the first place — there is no
way to reach "1 call for the direct case" without either (a) skipping
the ambiguity check for some messages on a cheaper heuristic, which
reintroduces exactly the guessing this feature exists to replace with
a real judgment call, or (b) merging the ambiguity judgment and the
actual pedagogical answer into one fast-tier call, which breaks the
judgment/response tier split this codebase uses everywhere else
(ExtractRequest+Teach, GroundConcept+MismatchDetector, detect_prior_
reference+Teach — a narrow structural check is always a separate,
cheaper call from the response it gates) and would make `FinalAnswer`'s
"best tier: this is what the student actually sees" reasoning
meaningless. Two calls for a direct exchange, never more, is the
actual guarantee this module makes.

`FinalAnswer` is given the exact same compact recent-history window
`AssessAndBranch` was given this turn (see loop.py's
`_handle_disambiguation_turn`, which computes it once and threads it
into both calls). This is conversation continuity, not the portrait/
concept-graph/planner "scaffolding" this module's design deliberately
excludes — see `FinalAnswer`'s own docstring for the live failure
(an off-topic answer to a message containing a bare, context-dependent
reference — "sketch **that**") that motivated adding it: `AssessAndBranch`
correctly used its own history to judge the message unambiguous, but
`FinalAnswer` was never given that same history to resolve what the
message was actually asking about.

REUSE, not rebuild: `LLMClient`/tiering (fast for `AssessAndBranch`/
`GenerateOptions`, same tier as `ExtractRequest`/hypothesis_generator's
own `GenerateOptions` — a narrow structural judgment, not the final
response; best for `FinalAnswer`, same tier as `Teach`/`BaselineTeach`
— it IS the response); `Option`/`OptionStatus`/`OptionProposal`
(models.py, unchanged) for the click-resolve channel; `node_calls`
audit logging (CLAUDE.md invariant 2 — every one of the 1-3 calls
below is a real node, routed through `SessionLoop._call_node`).

Not literally reused: the `branches`/`options` SQL tables themselves.
`disambiguation_branches`/`disambiguation_turns`/`disambiguation_options`
(migration 029) are new, parallel tables with the reshaped, flat shape
described above — see that migration's own comment for why
`options.branch_id`'s FK to `branches(id)` makes literally sharing the
existing tables impossible, and why the existing tables must not be
altered to accommodate this new, separate mode (the full tree-based
system still depends on every column they already have).

Append-only, same discipline as branches.py/options.py (CLAUDE.md
invariant 9 for this store specifically): no delete method, no DELETE
SQL, resolution is a status transition (open -> matched/superseded)
via UPDATE only.

    docstring, 3a/3b are branch-resolution logic, not a call): the one
    call that actually answers the student. Has no fallback — its
    output IS the turn — mirroring Teach's own discipline; a failure
    here is `SessionLoop._handle_disambiguation_turn`'s concern, not
    this class's (same split as Teach/loop.py).

    `branch_context` is the selected reading's statement, only present
    when this turn resolved a click; None means either the original
    message was never ambiguous, or nothing was resolved to select
    from.

    `recent_history` is the exact same compact window
    `AssessAndBranch` was given this turn (see loop.py's
    `_handle_disambiguation_turn`, which computes it once and threads
    it into both calls) — NOT new scaffolding in the sense the "no
    scaffolding" design goal meant (no portrait, no concept graph, no
    planner): it is conversation continuity, the same category of
    input Teach's own `recent_history` already carries in the full
    system. Withholding it from FinalAnswer while giving it to
    AssessAndBranch was a live-confirmed bug, not a deliberate
    asymmetry: a message like "can you sketch **that**?" is judged
    unambiguous by AssessAndBranch (there is only one plausible
    *reading* of the request), but "that" is a bare reference that
    still requires the conversation so far to resolve — and
    FinalAnswer, given nothing but the bare message, is free to
    hallucinate an entirely unrelated topic to sketch. Confirmed live:
    exactly this happened (a math conversation about the chain rule
    produced a cell-membrane biology diagram) before this field
    existed.

    `memory_context` is set only on a memory-skip turn (see
    memory.py's module docstring / loop.py's `_handle_disambiguation_turn`):
    a *past* turn's fact — possibly from an earlier session entirely —
    that a `ConfirmFactMatch` call already judged resolves this
    message, so `AssessAndBranch` never ran at all this turn.
    Deliberately a separate parameter from `branch_context`, not reused
    for it: `branch_context` is this turn's own branch selection;
    `memory_context` is a durable fact from possibly a different
    session, and the two must never be conflated in the prompt (a
    student's current message being treated as if it just went through
    branching when it didn't would misrepresent what actually happened
    this turn).

    `learner_history_block` (history_block.py) is a third, separate
    kind of context from `recent_history`/`memory_context` above: a
    pre-rendered block of this learner's PAST -- across sessions, built
    from `retrieval.retrieve()`'s output -- rather than the live turn's
    own continuity. Empty string when the history-block feature is
    disabled or nothing was retrieved; FinalAnswer does no rendering or
    retrieval of its own, only places whatever pre-built string it is
    given.

    `structural_requirement` (interaction_nodes.render_structural_requirement)
    is a FOURTH, deliberately different kind of context, placed ABOVE
    everything else: a real diagnostic found that a stated learner
    preference rendered as background prose -- even placed prominently,
    even right before the question -- did not reliably beat the
    model's own prior about how to explain a familiar topic. Phrasing
    the same fact as a requirement on the answer's shape, positioned
    at the top of the prompt rather than folded into history, measurably
    did better. Empty string whenever this learner has never explicitly
    stated a standing preference.

    `reference_bindings_block` (reference_bindings.py) is a FIFTH kind
    of context, placed above `learner_history_block` (per that
    feature's own spec): known, exact-matched meanings of this
    learner's own recurring shorthand phrases ("the usual", "my
    project"). Unlike `structural_requirement`, it is deliberately
    framed as PRIOR meaning rather than a requirement -- the model is
    told to use it only when it fits and to defer to the current
    message when that clearly indicates something else, since an
    incorrectly-applied binding (unlike an ignored structural
    requirement) actively produces a wrong answer, not just a
    differently-shaped right one.

    Best tier: this is what the student actually sees, same tier as
    Teach/BaselineTeach.

    `domain_config` (domain_config.py) switches the register between
    tutor/student (education, the default) and assistant/person
    (general) -- the opening role line and the closing "never end by
