"""Append-only store for `evidence_records` (migration 033) — a
durable, labeled log of verification findings.

See CLAUDE.md invariant 11: no delete method, no DELETE SQL. A finding,
once recorded, is a historical fact about what a check saw at that
moment. `source_type` keeps a staged mechanism test (`STAGED_VERIFICATION`)
visibly separate from evidence produced by a real student session
(`ORGANIC_SESSION`), so the Evidence page can never present one as the
other.
