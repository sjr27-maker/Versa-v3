-- versa: two additions needed to show a per-turn hypothesis delta in
-- a UI ("what rose, what fell, what resurrected from dormant")
-- without the UI computing anything itself.
--
-- 1. evidence_refs gains the *resulting* probability/confidence from
--    the reweight() call that created it — the "after" value. Nullable
--    because existing evidence predates this and has no way to recover
--    it; same honesty as list_by_learner's documented
--    zero-evidence-is-unattributable gap. Going forward, reweight()
--    always writes both.
--
-- 2. hypothesis_tier_changes is a new, tiny append-only log — tier
--    transitions (retier()/resurrect()) currently leave no trace at
--    all, so "resurrected from dormant" has nothing to read. No delete
--    method, no DELETE SQL, same append-only pattern as every other
--    store in this project (CLAUDE.md invariant 1's rule extended
--    here, not a new numbered invariant — this is a natural extension
--    of hypotheses' own audit trail, not a separate concern the way
--    branches/revisions were).
