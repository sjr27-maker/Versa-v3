-- ON DELETE RESTRICT (never CASCADE), same reasoning as every other FK
-- in this schema: sessions are meant to be append-only (see
-- TranscriptStore's docstring), so it must be impossible to remove a
-- learner a session still points to.
--
-- Backfill: the dev DB had pre-existing session row(s) from before
-- learner identity existed. Rather than deleting them (sessions/turns
-- are append-only by the same convention as the rest of this schema)
-- or leaving learner_id nullable (which would silently make "which
-- learner is this" optional everywhere downstream, defeating the point
-- of adding it), every such session is backfilled onto one placeholder
-- learner before the NOT NULL constraint is added. On a fresh schema
-- (the normal case — tests rebuild from scratch) there are zero
-- sessions and this is a no-op.
