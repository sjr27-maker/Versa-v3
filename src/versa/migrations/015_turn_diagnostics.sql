-- versa: turn_diagnostics — one row per handle_turn() call, closing
-- the gap between what's already computed in loop.py each turn (call
-- counts, the MAX_CALLS_PER_TURN guardrail, entropy_bits, warnings)
-- and what's actually queryable afterward. Before this, the guardrail
-- firing and warning conditions were only ever logged, never
-- persisted — a UI's diagnostics view needs to read these, not
-- re-derive them, per this feature's "zero business logic in the UI"
-- constraint.
--
-- Append-only: no delete method, no DELETE SQL, same pattern as every
-- other store in this project (CLAUDE.md invariant 1's rule extended
-- here — a turn's diagnostics are a historical fact once recorded,
-- same as a node_calls row).
--
-- teach_failed is its own column, not folded into warnings: downstream
-- analysis (branch match rate, portrait stats, call-count aggregates)
-- needs to filter these turns out by column, not by string-matching a
-- JSONB warnings list.
