-- versa: branches — a speculative, regenerated-each-turn prediction
-- tree, distinct from the durable hypotheses table.
--
-- HypothesisGenerator rebuilds this tree every turn: depth 0 is always
-- 3-5 candidate "intents" for why the student sent their last message;
-- deeper depths condition on their parent and get progressively more
-- specific, stopping wherever a branch stops being worth expanding
-- (see should_expand_branch in hypothesis_generator.py). Every branch
-- — leaf or not — carries its own predicted_next_turn, so whatever
-- depth it stops at, it stays checkable against the student's real
-- next message.
--
-- Append-only, same pattern as world_model_revisions and every other
-- store in this project (CLAUDE.md invariant 6): no delete method, no
-- DELETE SQL, status moves open -> matched/unmatched/superseded via
-- UPDATE only.
--
-- This is deliberately NOT wired into hypotheses/evidence_refs in this
-- migration: a branch match does not write into HypothesisStore. See
-- CLAUDE.md invariant 6's rationale.
