-- append-only (CLAUDE.md invariant 1). Cascading a hypothetical turn
-- deletion into evidence_refs would silently destroy the audit trail;
-- RESTRICT makes any future attempt to remove a referenced turn fail
-- loudly instead. There is no path today that deletes a turn, and this
-- constraint is here so there's still no such path by accident.
