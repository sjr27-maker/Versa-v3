-- versa: disambiguation_turns / disambiguation_branches — the minimal
-- three-call disambiguation mode's own append-only storage (see
-- disambiguate.py's module docstring). A new, separate mode, not a
-- reshaping of the existing branches/branch_generations tables: those
-- stay exactly as they are, still backing the full tree-based system.
-- disambiguation_branches is the flat counterpart to `branches` —
-- no parent_id, no depth, no requires_evidence — reusing that table's
-- column *shape* (id, session_id, turn_index, statement, status) at
-- the model level (models.py's DisambiguationBranch) without touching
-- the original table, which this mode's own migration must not alter:
-- the full system's HypothesisGenerator still depends on every column
-- branches already has.
--
-- disambiguation_options reuses the existing `option_status` enum type
-- (open/selected/superseded) and the `Option` pydantic model as-is
-- (see models.py) — it is a parallel table, not the same `options`
-- table, only because `options.branch_id` has a hard FK to
-- `branches(id)`: a disambiguation branch lives in a different table,
-- so it cannot satisfy that constraint. The click-resolve *mechanism*
-- (mark an option selected, mark its branch matched, supersede the
-- rest) is reused verbatim in Python; only the two tables it reads and
-- writes are new.
--
-- Append-only, same pattern as branches/options (CLAUDE.md invariant
-- 6/8, and this table's own new entry): no delete method, no DELETE
-- SQL, status moves open -> matched/superseded via UPDATE only.
