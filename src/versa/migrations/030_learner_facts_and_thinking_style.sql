-- versa: the memory layer built on top of minimal_branch
-- (ReasoningMode.DISAMBIGUATE) -- see memory.py's module docstring.
-- Additive: DisambiguationStore's own tables (migration 029) are
-- untouched. This is a derived, searchable layer on top of them (and
-- of the plain student turns), not a replacement.
--
-- `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` first, so a from-empty-
-- schema replay (a fresh environment, or the test suite's own
-- drop-and-replay-all-migrations fixture) self-documents and picks
-- this up automatically rather than needing a manual step first.
--
-- 768-dimensional embeddings (see embeddings.py's EMBEDDING_DIM):
-- gemini-embedding-001 is a Matryoshka-trained model natively
-- producing 3072 dimensions, but this pgvector build (0.8.6) caps
-- HNSW-indexable vectors at 2000 dimensions -- verified live, a
-- vector(3072) column rejects `CREATE INDEX ... USING hnsw` outright.
-- 768 is comfortably under that cap and still a strong embedding size.
--
-- HNSW over IVFFlat: IVFFlat's list-count parameter needs tuning
-- against the table's eventual row count and performs poorly while a
-- table is small/empty -- exactly this feature's own starting
-- condition (a few facts per learner, growing slowly). HNSW has no
-- such "needs enough rows first" requirement and is pgvector's own
-- current general recommendation.
--
-- Append-only, same discipline as every other store in this project
-- (CLAUDE.md invariant 10): no delete method, no DELETE SQL.
-- `learner_facts` never updates a row once written -- a fact is a
-- historical record of what was true at that turn. Retirement of a
-- `thinking_style_candidates` row is a status transition (candidate ->
-- confirmed/retired) via UPDATE, same resurrection-over-deletion
-- principle as HypothesisStore's tier transitions.
