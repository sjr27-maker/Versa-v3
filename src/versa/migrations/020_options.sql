-- versa: options — the clickable-button evidence channel. Generated
-- by GenerateOptions from live branches with an unsatisfied
-- requires_evidence (migration 019), one option per branch by
-- construction (GenerateOptions rejects and regenerates any mapping
-- that isn't a clean 1:1). A click is an unambiguous fact about which
-- branch's evidence requirement is now true — no interpretation layer,
-- unlike free text.
--
-- Append-only, same pattern as branches/branch_generations (CLAUDE.md
-- invariant 6, and its own entry in CLAUDE.md for this table): no
-- delete method, no DELETE SQL, status moves open ->
-- selected/superseded via UPDATE only. Regenerated every turn from the
-- current branch set and superseded the same way branches are (see
-- HypothesisGenerator.resolve()) — never carried forward.
