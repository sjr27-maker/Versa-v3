"""SessionMode — the two architectures a versa session can run under,
now that the full Diagnose/Infer/Update/Replan/Plan reasoning path and
the original tree-based branch system have been removed.

- `MINIMAL_BRANCH` (the default): the disambiguation flow (see
  disambiguate.py) — AssessAndBranch -> [DisambiguationOptions] ->
  FinalAnswer, at most three LLM calls per exchange, plus the memory
  layer (memory.py).
- `BASELINE`: plain LLM, one call per turn, no reasoning scaffolding
  at all (SessionLoop._handle_bypass_turn / baseline.BaselineTeach).
  The floor `MINIMAL_BRANCH` is measured against.

`AblationConfig` is kept as the persisted, per-session shape (stored in
`sessions.ablation_config`, read by `TranscriptStore.get_ablation_config`)
so `TurnDiagnosticsStore.mean_cost_by_config` can
still group turns by which mode ran. It now carries exactly one field.
A NULL `sessions.ablation_config` still reads back as the default —
`AblationConfig()` — which is now MINIMAL_BRANCH rather than the old
full system.
