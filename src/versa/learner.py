"""LearnerStore: identity-level records only.

No behavioral logic lives here — what a learner knows, believes, or is
working toward belongs on `Hypothesis` (evidence-backed claims) or
`OverlayEntry` (current concept-mastery state). This is just "which
conversations belong to the same person," created once per learner and
referenced by `sessions.learner_id` (NOT NULL, ON DELETE RESTRICT — a
learner can't be removed out from under sessions that reference it).

No delete method here either, same append-only spirit as the rest of
this schema: once a learner exists, sessions/turns may already
reference it, so removing one would orphan history the same way
deleting a hypothesis or a concept would.
