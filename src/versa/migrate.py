"""Standalone migration runner — the deploy-time path (Cloud SQL etc.).

Applies `src/versa/migrations/*.sql` to a database in filename order,
exactly once each, tracked in a `schema_migrations` ledger table.
Idempotent: re-running applies nothing new. Each migration and its
ledger row commit together in one transaction, so a mid-run failure
leaves a consistent applied prefix — fix the cause and re-run to
continue.

The pytest suite does NOT use this: `tests/conftest.py` drops and
replays the whole schema every session and needs no ledger. This
module is only for real, persistent databases.
