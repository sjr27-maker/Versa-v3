"""The memory layer — a derived, searchable record built on top of
minimal_branch (ReasoningMode.DISAMBIGUATE), NOT a replacement for
anything DisambiguationStore already does: migration 029's tables stay
exactly as they are, untouched by this module.

WHY THIS EXISTS: every disambiguation-mode turn today is answered
fresh, with no memory of how past uncertainty in THIS student was
actually resolved. Two paths converge on the same underlying store,
`learner_facts` (migration 030):

- WITHIN a session: `EmbedAndSearchFacts` + `ConfirmFactMatch` run
  before `AssessAndBranch` on every fresh message (see loop.py's
  `_handle_disambiguation_turn`). If a past fact — possibly written
  just one turn ago, in this same session — strongly matches and a
  confirmation call agrees it actually resolves the current message,
  branching is skipped entirely and `FinalAnswer` runs directly with
  that fact as context. This is deliberately visible and auditable,
  never a silent shortcut: `turn_diagnostics.branching_skipped_by_memory`
  (migration 031) is set whenever it happens, alongside which fact
  caused it.
- ACROSS sessions: `SummarizeSessionPath` labels the abstract
  order-structure of one session's facts (concrete-before-abstract,
  or the reverse — never the specific topic), and
  `ConfirmThinkingStyleMatch` decides whether that matches an existing
  `thinking_style_candidates` row closely enough to count as one more
  independent confirmation. This ONLY ever runs as a background,
  session-end step (`SessionLoop.consolidate_session`) — never live,
  mid-turn (see that method's own docstring for why).

THE ONE RULE EVERYTHING HERE SERVES: nothing below may assert a
pattern before it's actually been earned across independent evidence.
Concretely:
  - `EmbedAndSearchFacts`' vector search only ever FINDS a candidate to
    ask about; only `ConfirmFactMatch`'s structured yes/no is allowed
    to actually skip branching. Cosine similarity alone never decides
    anything live.
  - Likewise, `thinking_style_candidates.confirmation_count`/
    `session_ids` only ever grow via `ConfirmThinkingStyleMatch` saying
    yes, never from a candidate merely coming back as the nearest
    vector match.
  - `ThinkingStyleCandidate` only gets fed into any live session's
    prompt once `confirmation_count` crosses
    `MemoryConfig.thinking_style_promotion_threshold` — a config value
    deliberately set well above "2-3 sessions could be coincidence"
    (see MemoryConfig's own docstring for the exact number and why).

Append-only (CLAUDE.md invariant 10): no delete method on either
store, no DELETE SQL anywhere in this module or migration 030.
`learner_facts` rows are never mutated after insert; a
`thinking_style_candidates` row's `status` moves candidate ->
confirmed/retired via UPDATE only, same resurrection-over-deletion
principle as HypothesisStore's tiers.
