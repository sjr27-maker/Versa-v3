# probe

## Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

- `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string (dev DB and the test suite
  share this by default; running `pytest` wipes and rebuilds it from
  migrations). For a real, persistent database (Cloud SQL, staging),
  apply the schema with `probe migrate` — it runs every
  `src/probe/migrations/*.sql` in order, once each, tracked in a
  `schema_migrations` ledger table, and is safe to re-run. `probe
  migrate --status` shows applied/pending; `probe migrate --baseline`
  adopts a database that already has the full schema but no ledger
  (stamps every migration as applied without running it). `pytest`
  does not use this path.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — required for any real (non-stub) LLM call. Get one
  at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey. Every `probe` command that
  calls an LLM (`chat`, `consolidate-session`) accepts `--stub` to run against
  `StubLLMClient` instead, which needs no key and costs nothing.

`GEMINI_MODEL_FAST` / `GEMINI_MODEL_CAPABLE` / `GEMINI_MODEL_BEST` are
optional overrides for the tier→model mapping in `model_config.py` —
only needed if the defaults there go stale (Gemini preview model ids
shift over time).

Run `probe serve` for the web UI — a single-page app
(`src/probe/static/`) over a small Starlette API (`src/probe/webserver.py`),
same `SessionLoop` the CLI drives, no auth, local only. Binds `0.0.0.0`
and reads `$PORT` by default (so the container needs no flags); pass
`--host 127.0.0.1` / `--port` to override. The old Streamlit UI
(`probe web`, `src/probe/webui/`) has been removed. Every `probe` CLI
command (`chat`, `consolidate-session`, `migrate`) still works
independently of the web UI.

## Invariants

### 1. The hypothesis store is append-only

The `HypothesisStore` (and any store that persists reasoning state) must
never delete rows. Concretely:

- No `delete` / `remove` methods on the store class.
- No `DELETE` SQL anywhere in the store module or its migrations.
- Retirement is modeled by moving rows to the `archived` tier, not by
  removing them. Archived hypotheses can be brought back with
  `resurrect()`.
- Evidence is appended, never mutated in place. `reweight()` records new
  probability/confidence *and* appends the evidence ref that justified
  the update — it does not overwrite prior evidence.

Why: probe's whole premise is auditing how beliefs evolved over time.
Deleting a hypothesis or overwriting its evidence destroys the record
we're trying to build. If something "shouldn't be there anymore," archive
it; the trail matters more than tidiness.

### 2. Every node call is persisted to `node_calls`

Every invocation of a Node's primary async method (`Node.run(...)`) must
be recorded to the `node_calls` table with:

- `node_name`
- `session_id`
- `turn_index`
- `input_json`  (kwargs to `run()`, JSON-serialized; non-serializable
  dependencies like `HypothesisStore` are excluded)
- `output_json` (return value, JSON-serialized)
- `timestamp`

This is enforced by routing every node call through
`SessionLoop._call_node()` rather than invoking `node.run(...)` directly.
Do not call `node.run(...)` from production code paths outside the loop.

Why: the audit trail is the product. If a node executed and we don't
have its inputs+outputs on disk, we can't reconstruct how a belief
changed — which defeats the point of building probe in the first place.

### 3. Value-function terms are individually disable-able

Every term in the `ValueFunction` (learning_value, information_value,
long_term_value, time_cost, cognitive_cost, frustration_risk) must be
independently toggle-able via `ValueFunctionConfig` without any code
changes. A disabled term contributes 0 to `score()` and skips its LLM
calls entirely. The full six-term breakdown must survive on every
`ActionScore` even when some terms are zero, so ablation runs are
comparable side-by-side in `node_calls`.

Why: this codebase is a research artifact whose main question is which
terms actually matter. If turning one off requires editing code, we
can't run apples-to-apples ablations. Keep the config knob, keep the
breakdown, don't collapse to a single float.

### 4. RETIRED — the concept graph is gone

This invariant governed `ConceptGraph` and `concept_nodes`, both of
which no longer exist: `src/probe/concept_graph.py` and
`src/probe/seed.py` were deleted in commit 5451b95, and migration
`032_retire_full_mode.sql` drops `concept_nodes`, `concept_graphs`,
`concept_prerequisites`, and `learner_overlay`. There is no
`ConceptNode` model, no `ConceptGraph` class, and no `probe seed-graph`
command; `probe chat` reports "minimal_branch mode — no concept graph".

The entry is kept as a numbered tombstone rather than deleted so the
later invariants keep the numbers they are cross-referenced by —
invariants 6-11 each say "the same AST-based check used for invariants
1, 4, ..." and renumbering would silently break every one of those
references.

Do not restore the concept graph in order to satisfy a task that
assumes it exists. It was removed on measured evidence (it lost to a
plain-LLM baseline at 20-40x the cost), and nothing in the current
architecture reads one — so any structure rebuilt here would have zero
consumers by construction.

### 5. World-model revisions are append-only

`WorldModelRevisionStore` must never delete rows. Concretely:

- No `delete` / `remove` methods on the class.
- No `DELETE` SQL anywhere in the `revision` module or its migrations.
- Resolution is modeled by moving a revision's `status` from `pending`
  to `approved` or `rejected` via UPDATE, not by removing it. A
  rejected revision stays on record as a rejected claim, not as if it
  had never been proposed.
- `approve()` never overwrites `proposed_change` — it records the
  human-confirmed structured edit separately, as
  `applied_field_updates`, on the same row. The original free-text
  claim and the edit that was actually applied both remain visible.

This is a separate invariant from #1 and #4, not a restatement of
either: the rationale is again distinct, so it gets its own entry.

Why: a `WorldModelRevision` is a claim about the concept graph, evidence-
backed the same way a `Hypothesis` is a claim about the learner — and
probe's premise (invariant 1) is auditing how *all* beliefs evolved, not
just learner-facing ones. Deleting a resolved revision would erase the
record of what was proposed, what a human decided about it, and why —
exactly the trail that makes a rejected-but-plausible claim or an
approved edit's justification recoverable later.

### 6. The branch store is append-only

`BranchStore` (`branches`/`branch_generations`) must never delete rows.
Concretely:

- No `delete` / `remove` methods on the class.
- No `DELETE` SQL anywhere in the `branches` module or its migrations.
- Resolution is modeled by moving a branch's `status` from `open` to
  `matched`, `unmatched`, or `superseded` via UPDATE, not by removing
  it. A generation that turned out to predict nothing right stays on
  record as `unmatched`, not as if it had never been generated.
- Verified by the same AST-based check used for invariants 1 and 4.

This is a separate invariant from #1, not a restatement of it: the
rationale is different, so it gets its own entry rather than being
folded into the hypothesis-store rule.

Why: `HypothesisGenerator` rebuilds a speculative prediction tree every
turn and discards most of it — but "discard" means retiring branches to
a terminal status, the same way a hypothesis retires to `archived`
rather than disappearing, not erasing the record that a generation
happened and what it predicted. Crucially, this store does **not**
write into `HypothesisStore`: a branch match is a single-turn,
episodic signal, and probe's premise (invariant 1) is auditing
*confirmed*, evidence-backed belief — promoting a branch into a real
`Hypothesis` on one coincidental match would let episodic noise
corrupt that durable record. Only a future consolidation step (not
built yet — deliberately deferred until real match data exists to
define "a pattern that repeats") would ever bridge the two; until
then, the wall between episodic branches and durable hypotheses is
itself part of what this invariant protects.

### 7. Turn diagnostics and hypothesis tier changes are append-only

`TurnDiagnosticsStore` (`turn_diagnostics`) and
`HypothesisStore.list_tier_changes`'s backing table
(`hypothesis_tier_changes`) must never delete rows. Concretely:

- No `delete` / `remove` methods on either class.
- No `DELETE` SQL anywhere in `diagnostics.py`, or in `store.py`'s
  `hypothesis_tier_changes` writes, or in either one's migrations.
- `turn_diagnostics` has one row per `handle_turn()` call, written
  once, never updated afterward — a turn's recorded diagnostics
  (call counts, whether the guardrail fired, warnings, whether Teach
  failed) are a historical fact the instant that turn finishes.
- `hypothesis_tier_changes` only ever grows via `retier()`'s INSERT on
  a real transition — never mutated or pruned.
- Verified by the same AST-based check used for invariants 1, 4, and 6.

This is a separate invariant from the others, not a restatement of
any of them: `turn_diagnostics` and `hypothesis_tier_changes` are
audit trail in the same spirit as `node_calls` (invariant 2), but they
didn't exist when that invariant was written and are new stores in
their own right, so they get their own entry rather than being
silently folded into invariant 2's wording after the fact.

Why: both exist specifically so the web UI can *read* what already
happened instead of recomputing it — a per-turn call-count breakdown,
whether `MAX_CALLS_PER_TURN` fired, a hypothesis's tier history. If
either could be edited or pruned, "zero business logic in the UI"
would quietly stop being true: a UI that can't trust the record to be
complete has to start re-deriving things itself, which is exactly the
failure mode this whole feature was built to avoid.

### 8. The options store is append-only

`OptionStore` (`options`) must never delete rows. Concretely:

- No `delete` / `remove` methods on the class.
- No `DELETE` SQL anywhere in the `options` module or its migrations.
- Resolution is modeled by moving an option's `status` from `open` to
  `selected` or `superseded` via UPDATE, not by removing it. An option
  the student never clicked stays on record as `superseded`, not as if
  it had never been offered.
- Verified by the same AST-based check used for invariants 1, 4, 6,
  and 7.

This is a separate invariant from invariant 6, not a restatement of
it: options and branches are different tables with different
rationale, so it gets its own entry rather than being folded into the
branch-store wording.

Why: an option is the record of what was actually offered to the
student and which claim they did or didn't affirm — the evidence trail
for `Branch.evidence_satisfied`. Deleting a superseded option would
erase proof that a specific, unambiguous choice was on the table and
not taken, which is exactly the kind of fact CLAUDE.md invariant 1's
"audit how beliefs evolved" premise depends on, extended to the
options channel: an option is not written into `HypothesisStore`
either (same wall as invariant 6 describes for branches) — it only
ever flips `evidence_satisfied` on the branch it maps to.

### 9. The disambiguation store is append-only

`DisambiguationStore` (`disambiguation_turns`/`disambiguation_branches`/
`disambiguation_options`) must never delete rows. Concretely:

- No `delete` / `remove` methods on the class.
- No `DELETE` SQL anywhere in the `disambiguate` module or its
  migrations.
- Resolution is modeled by moving a branch's or option's `status` from
  `open` to `matched`/`selected` or `superseded` via UPDATE, not by
  removing it — same transitions as invariants 6 and 8, on this mode's
  own tables.
- `disambiguation_turns` is written once per `AssessAndBranch` call,
  unconditionally, whether or not `needs_branches` fires — a turn
  judged unambiguous is still a queryable row with zero branches, not
  a gap.
- Verified by the same AST-based check used for invariants 1, 4, 6, 7,
  and 8.

This is a separate invariant from invariants 6 and 8, not a
restatement of either: `ReasoningMode.DISAMBIGUATE` (see ablation.py)
is a wholly separate reasoning architecture from the branch tree/
options system those invariants describe, running against its own
parallel tables rather than the `branches`/`options` tables — see
disambiguate.py's module docstring for why those tables couldn't be
literally reused (`options.branch_id`'s FK to `branches(id)`) and,
more importantly, why they shouldn't be: the existing tree-based
system still depends on every column `branches` already has, and this
new mode must not require altering it.

Why: same rationale as invariants 6 and 8, extended to this mode — a
distinct reading the student typed past, or a branch set generated for
a message later judged unambiguous, is still a fact about how this
mode reasoned about that turn. Deleting any of it would erase the same
kind of "what was actually offered, and what happened to it" trail
invariant 8 protects, just for a different architecture.

### 10. The memory layer is append-only

`LearnerFactStore` (`learner_facts`) and `ThinkingStyleStore`
(`thinking_style_candidates`) must never delete rows. Concretely:

- No `delete` / `remove` methods on either class.
- No `DELETE` SQL anywhere in the `memory` module or its migrations.
- `learner_facts` rows are never mutated after insert — a fact is a
  historical record of what was true at that turn, written once by
  `WriteLearnerFact`, read many times by later searches, never edited.
- A `thinking_style_candidates` row's `status` moves `candidate` ->
  `confirmed`/`retired` via UPDATE only, same resurrection-over-
  deletion principle as `HypothesisStore`'s tiers — a candidate that
  stops matching is retired, not erased, and `confirmation_count`/
  `session_ids` only ever grow, via `ThinkingStyleStore.confirm()`.
- Verified by the same AST-based check used for invariants 1, 4, 6, 7,
  8, and 9.

This is a separate invariant from the others, not a restatement of
any of them: the memory layer (`memory.py`) is a derived, searchable
layer built on top of `DisambiguationStore` (invariant 9), not the
same store or the same rationale — it exists to give minimal_branch
cross-turn and cross-session recall, a concern neither invariant 6, 8,
nor 9 was written to cover.

Why: `learner_facts` is the literal record of how past uncertainty in
a specific student was actually resolved — deleting or editing one
would let the system quietly forget something it once confirmed,
directly undermining the reason this layer exists (skip re-asking
what's already known). `thinking_style_candidates` is a hypothesis
about a cross-session pattern in exactly the same evidentiary sense
`Hypothesis` is a claim about a learner (invariant 1) — a candidate
that later stops matching is evidence the earlier confirmations were
wrong or the pattern faded, which is itself worth keeping on record,
not silently removing.

### 11. The evidence store is append-only

`EvidenceStore` (`evidence_records`, migration 033) must never delete
rows. Concretely:

- No `delete` / `remove` methods on the class.
- No `DELETE` SQL anywhere in the `evidence` module or its migration.
- A recorded finding is never edited after insert — it is a historical
  fact about what a check saw at that moment. A finding that later
  turns out to have been misleading is corrected by *adding* a new
  record next to it, not by changing or removing the old one.
- Verified by the same AST-based check used for invariants 1, 4, 6, 7,
  8, 9, and 10.

Why: `evidence_records` exists so verification findings survive with
their context intact — and the load-bearing part of that context is
`source_type`. A `staged_verification` row was produced by a
deliberate scripted run and can only show that a *mechanism functions*;
an `organic_session` row came from real use. If a row could be edited
or deleted, the record of "what was actually tested, under what
conditions, and what it showed" — the whole reason to keep this log —
stops being trustworthy, and a staged mechanism test could quietly be
made to read like proof the system adapted to a student. The
`summary` column is where that distinction is kept legible at a glance
("mechanism verified …", never "adapted to the student" for a staged
row); that wording is the writer's responsibility, but the row it
lives on must be immutable for the phrasing to mean anything later.
